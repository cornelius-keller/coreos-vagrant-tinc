# Coreos Encrypted Flannel Networking Demo with tinc

This is a demo how to encrypt the coreos intercontainer network using flannel and tinc and vagrant.
All relevant scripts and details are in the user-data file (cloud-config).

For more information on how to setup coreos vagrant please refer to the orignal coreos vagrant documentation https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-on-vagrant.html .

While playing around with it you might find the update_cloudconfig.sh script useful.
